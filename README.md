# Unity-DeliveryMan

A game I made about driving a car picking up packages and delivering it to locations, it includes speed boosts and bumps that slow you down.

I'm still new to making games so I'm not quite sure how am I supposed to effectively upload game projects on GitHub, if someone has useful advice to give I'm all ears!!
